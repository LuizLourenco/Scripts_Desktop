SetProxy:

We have some problems in the company environment with users of Windows7 or Windows10 computers using a network domain where proxy settings for some reason are lost, even though it is running GPUPDATE.EXE, this problem can not be solved at the same time.

For this reason, a lot of users usually call our service center or Service Desk, but this issue can increase the demand from IT team of service capacity because of a simple problem.

There are several ways to solve this problem. So we opted for a solution where the user can interact by triggering the script through an icon on the desktop.
